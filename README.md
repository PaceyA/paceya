<h1>Hi There 👋, I'm Alex Pacey</h1>
<h3>Welcome to my GitHub</h3>

<p>I am Alex Pacey. I am a software developer from the UK and have a undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I am experienced in a number of programming languages and frameworks 
  and have been a full stack developer for a number of years. I am trying to be more productive outside of work and am spending some time building projects of my own in a variety of different areas.
